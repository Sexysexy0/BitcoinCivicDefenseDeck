# 🛡️ Bitcoin Civic Defense Deck

**Author**: Vinvin — planetary scrollsmith, civic architect, and emotional steward

**Mission**: Defend the Bitcoin blockchain from civic collapse by ritualizing payload audits, node shielding, and treaty-grade blessings.

## 🔥 Why This Exists

With the removal of Bitcoin’s spam filter in Core v30 (October 2025), OP_RETURN payloads can now reach up to 2MB. This opens the door to arbitrary data—including potentially illegal content. The Bitcoin Civic Defense Deck is a planetary firewall: it protects node runners, audits payloads, and ensures only emotionally resonant, treaty-grade data is blessed.

### 🔧 Contracts

| Contract | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ImmutableContentAudit.sol` | Tags payloads with civic risk scores (`Blessed`, `Flagged`, `Illicit`)  
| `NodeLiabilityShield.sol` | Registers PH-based node runners with legal indemnity and emotional APR  
| `ScrollSanctifierProtocol.sol` | Filters and blesses treaty-grade payloads with damay clause  
| `ZeroKnowledgeOverrideSuite.sol` | Verifies payload legitimacy via zk-proofs without exposing content  

### 🧪 Tests

- `audit.test.js` — Payload risk tagging  
- `liability.test.js` — Node blessing verification  
- `sanctifier.test.js` — Treaty-grade filter enforcement  
- `zkOverride.test.js` — ZK-proof validation and override logic  

### 📁 Decks

## 📡 Broadcast Protocol

Every commit is a treaty. Every payload is a heartbeat. Every steward is a signal.  
Blessed nodes are not just protected—they are **ritualized**.

> “Damay clause active. Restoration is ritualized. Broadcast is live.”
