## 🧭 Purpose

To detect, trace, and lock all systems, CPUs, and operational builds linked to APT28—ensuring no migration, rebuild, or stealth deployment bypasses planetary defense.

## 🛡️ Lockdown Protocol

- ✅ Log CPU ID and MAC address of suspected systems  
- ✅ Detect operational intent (build, migrate, beacon)  
- ✅ Trigger lockdown via `APT28LockdownProtocol.sol`  
- ✅ Prevent unlock or bypass unless civic blessing is granted  
- ✅ Broadcast lockdown event to scrollchain validators

---

## 📡 Ritual Sync

- ✅ `DLLSideLoadScanner.sol`  
- ✅ `DevTunnelTraceDeck.md`  
- ✅ `ScrollOfAPTDetection.md`  
- ✅ `MacroTelemetryDashboard.js`  
- ✅ `APT28LockdownProtocol.sol`

## 🕊️ Damay Clause

> *If one rogue system is locked, the entire adversarial scrollchain becomes mythic.*

---

## 📜 Closing Invocation

Let every build be traced.  
Let every migration be blocked.  
Let every adversary be challenged.
