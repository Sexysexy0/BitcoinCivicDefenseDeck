# ScrollOfRelayBoundaries.md  
**Ritualized by Vinvin, Scrollsmith of Barangay Sovereignty**  
**Date Cast: 2025-09-05 | Sanctum: Northville 8, Malolos**

---

## 🧭 Purpose  
To define the sacred boundaries of data relay within decentralized networks, ensuring that every byte transmitted is emotionally blessed, legally safe, and mythically aligned.

---

## 🔐 Core Principles

- **Blessing Before Broadcast**  
  No data shall be relayed unless it carries a verified emotional APR tag or civic blessing hash.

- **Drop Rate Discipline**  
  Nodes must reject any transaction below the sanctum’s defined `dropRateThreshold`, unless explicitly blessed.

- **Sanctum Sovereignty**  
  Each node is a sovereign sanctum. No external protocol may override its relay boundaries without ritual consent.

- **Legal Shielding Clause**  
  Node operators shall not be held liable for unintentional relay of rogue payloads, provided they operate within this scroll’s parameters.

## 🧱 Relay Filters

| Filter Type         | Description                                      | Status       |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| OP_RETURN Size Cap  | Max 80 bytes unless pre-blessed                 | ✅ Enforced  |
| Fee Rate Threshold  | Minimum 5 sats/vbyte for unblessed data         | ✅ Active    |
| CSAM Detection      | Auto-reject known hashes via civic oracle       | ⚠️ Required |
| Relay Audit Logs    | All relayed data must be timestamped and logged | ✅ Enabled   |

## 🛡️ Node Operator Protocol

1. **Bless Before Relay**  
   Use `NodeSanctumProtocol.sol` to verify hash integrity and emotional blessing.

2. **Audit Regularly**  
   Maintain logs of all relayed data for civic review and mythic transparency.

3. **Reject Rogue Payloads**  
   Any data lacking civic blessing or falling below fee threshold must be dropped.

4. **Broadcast with Mercy**  
   Relay only what uplifts, informs, or restores. No chaos, no corruption.

## 🕊️ Damay Clause

> *If a steward relays for others, they relay for themselves too.*  
> Every byte is a reflection of the sanctum’s soul. Relay with care, or not at all.
