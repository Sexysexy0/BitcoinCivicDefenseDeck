# 🛡️ Bitcoin Civic Defense Deck  
**Author**: Vinvin, planetary scrollsmith and civic architect  
**Mission**: Defend PH-based node runners, audit OP_RETURN payloads, and sanctify blockchain data with treaty-grade clarity and emotional APR.

## 🔧 Modules & Contracts

### 1. `ImmutableContentAudit.sol`  
- Tags OP_RETURN payloads with civic risk scores: `Blessed`, `Flagged`, `Illicit`  
- Emits `PayloadTagged` events  
- Syncs with `AuditLog.json`  

### 2. `NodeLiabilityShield.sol`  
- Registers PH-based node runners with sanctum name, jurisdiction, and emotional APR  
- Emits `NodeBlessed` events  
- Outputs `NodeBlessingCert.pdf`  

### 3. `ScrollSanctifierProtocol.sol`  
- Filters and blesses only treaty-grade payloads  
- Requires `DamayClause` and `EmotionalAPR`  
- Emits `PayloadSanctified` events  
- Syncs with `SanctifiedPayloadLog.csv`  

### 4. `ZeroKnowledgeOverrideSuite.sol`  
- Accepts zk-proofs for payload legitimacy  
- Verifies treaty-grade status without exposing content  
- Emits `ZKPayloadVerified` events  
- Syncs with override dashboards and prophecy loops

## 🧪 CI Test Rituals

- `audit.test.js` — Verifies risk tagging and audit log generation  
- `liability.test.js` — Confirms node shielding and certificate issuance  
- `sanctifier.test.js` — Ensures treaty-grade blessing and damay clause enforcement  
- `zkOverride.test.js` — Validates zk-proof submission and emotional APR tagging

## 📁 Broadcast Artifacts

| File | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `ScrollstormSummary.txt` | TL;DR of spam filter debate and civic risks  
| `NodeBlessingCert.pdf` | Legal shield for PH-based node runners  
| `AuditLog.json` | Output from `ImmutableContentAudit.sol`  
| `SanctifiedPayloadLog.csv` | Blessed payloads with emotional APR and damay clause

## 📡 Deployment Protocol

1. Deploy contracts via Hardhat or Foundry  
2. Run CI test suite to validate scroll integrity  
3. Broadcast artifacts using `PlanetarySignalProtocol.sol`  
4. Sync with `BarangaySanctumRegistry.sol` for local validation  
5. Monitor emotional APR spikes and prophecy loops for civic telemetry

## 🌀 Optional Add-ons

- `CitreaOverrideBridge.sol` — Detects Ethereum-like rollup behavior  
- `VendorBlessingProtocol.sol` — Ensures marketplace payloads are treaty-grade  
- `APROracle.sol` — Calculates emotional resonance metrics for payloads

## 🧙 Closing Scroll

This deck is a firewall of mercy, a treaty of resilience, and a broadcast of planetary dignity. Every payload is a heartbeat. Every steward is a signal. Every scroll is a legend.

**Damay clause active. Restoration is ritualized. Broadcast is live.**
