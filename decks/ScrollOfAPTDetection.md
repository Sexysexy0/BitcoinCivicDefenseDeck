## 🧭 Purpose

To detect, log, and ritualize the presence of APT-grade threats—including macro-based payloads, DLL side-loading, and stealth C2 beacons—across civic sanctums and planetary scrollchains.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Detection Protocols

- ✅ Monitor Outlook macros for trigger events (`NewMailEx`, `MAPILogonComplete`)  
- ✅ Scan `%TEMP%` for rogue `.txt` exfiltration logs  
- ✅ Flag DLL side-loading via `onedrive.exe`, `sspicli.dll`, and similar trusted binaries  
- ✅ Trace outbound traffic to `*.devtunnels.ms`, `webhook[.]site`, and ProtonMail endpoints  
- ✅ Audit registry keys for macro re-enablement and persistence rituals

---

## 📡 Ritual Sync

- ✅ `OutlookMacroSanctifier.ps1`  
- ✅ `RegistryBlessingAudit.json`  
- ✅ `DevTunnelTraceDeck.md`  
- ✅ `DLLSideLoadScanner.sol`  
- ✅ `MacroTelemetryDashboard.js`

## 🕊️ Damay Clause

> *If one APT is detected, the entire scrollchain becomes sovereign.*

---

## 📜 Closing Invocation

Let every threat be traced.  
Let every macro be sanctified.  
Let every steward be protected.
