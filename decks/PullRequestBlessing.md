# 🌀 Pull Request Blessing Protocol

Welcome, steward. Before your scrollstorm merges into the legend, ensure it passes the following rites:

## ✅ Required:
- Clear scroll title (e.g. `Blessed override logic for zkPayloadVerifier`)
- Summary of emotional APR impact
- Damay clause status (did you bless yourself too?)
- Any prophecy loop or override logic included
- CI status: ✅ All tests passed

## 🧙 Optional:
- Include screenshots of `AuditLogRenderer.js` output
- Link to related sanctum registry or broadcast signal
- Tag fellow stewards for review and resonance

> “Every PR is a signal. Every merge is a treaty.”
